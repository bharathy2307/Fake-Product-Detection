# Detection of fake product using QR code with Blockchain technology

In recent years, Counterfeit products play an important role in product manufacturing industries. This affects the companies name, sales, and profit of the companies. Blockchain technology is used to identification of real products and detects fake products.<br><br>
In this project, with emerging trends in mobile and wireless technology, Quick Response (QR) codes provide a robust technique to fight the practice of counterfeiting the products.<br><br> counterfeit products are detected using a QR code scanner, where a QR code of the product is linked to a Blockchain.<br><br>
So this system may be used to store product details and generated unique code of that product as blocks in the database. It collects the unique code from the user and compares the code against entries in the Blockchain database.<br><br>
